Restate + clarify scope
You want to spin up a lean, low-risk ghostwriting service focused on niches you already know (tech, compliance, veterans, career topics), starting with two strong samples and offering ghostwritten LinkedIn posts and short articles to small founders and execs.

Side hustle summary (3–5 bullets)

Audience: Small founders, execs, and professionals in tech, compliance, veteran, and career spaces.

Core value: Clear, authoritative LinkedIn posts and short articles that sound like the client and position them as credible, consistent voices in their niche.

Monetization: Per-word or per-piece ghostwriting, moving toward retainers for ongoing monthly content.

Your role: Solo operator/ghostwriter using AI as a drafting + editing assistant, not a replacement.

Constraints: Low budget (<$100), limited initial time (10–15 hours setup), need to reach $1K–$2K/mo within ~3–6 months.

Assumptions (model, audience, monetization)

Model (business model / offer structure)

You will start with 1–2 core offers:

Package A: LinkedIn post bundles (e.g., 4–8 posts per month).

Package B: Short articles (600–1,200 words) for blogs or LinkedIn Articles.
[Moderate risk] – Offer structure is standard but may need tightening once you see what founders actually buy.

Work is mostly asynchronous: client intake via a short questionnaire + occasional calls, then draft/feedback cycles.
[Low risk] – Fits typical ghostwriting workflows.

Audience

Primary audience is solo founders and small execs in tech/compliance/veteran/career niches who are active or want to be active on LinkedIn.
[Moderate risk] – May need to narrow further (e.g., “veteran tech founders”) for easier outreach and positioning.

These clients are reachable via LinkedIn DMs, targeted commenting, and warm introductions rather than paid ads.
[Low risk] – Standard for early-stage ghostwriters.

Monetization

Pricing will eventually land around $0.25–$0.50 per word or equivalent per-piece/retainer pricing.
[Moderate risk] – Achievable but may require starting lower or offering strong guarantees to get first clients.

Revenue target of $1K–$2K/mo assumes 3–8 clients on small retainers (e.g., $250–$500/mo each).
[Low risk] – Reasonable volume for solo capacity.

Decide if software is needed and what kind

Software required? → Optional, but strongly recommended.

Justification (1–2 sentences):
You can technically run this as pure service with a LinkedIn profile and Google Docs, but a focused, credible portfolio/offer site with intake form will significantly improve perceived professionalism and conversion from cold or warm outreach.

If run as pure service/process (no real software):

Use LinkedIn profile as primary “site” and proof.

Store samples in Google Docs folders; share links manually.

Manage pipeline and clients in a simple spreadsheet or Notion table.

If software is leveraged (recommended):
Primary artifact: Single-page portfolio + offer microsite with lead capture.

Why this artifact first (2–3 bullets):

Central place to showcase your 2+ niche samples with clear positioning (“Ghostwriting for tech/compliance/veteran leaders”).

Simple, frictionless way for prospects to understand offers and submit an inquiry or book a call without back-and-forth messaging.

Gives you a durable asset you can link in DMs, on LinkedIn, and in email, and later extend with testimonials and case studies.

Best-fit code base / stack

Project type

“Simple marketing + portfolio site with lead capture form.”

Tech stack

Frontend: Static site using a lightweight framework (Astro or Next.js with basic React components) and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Backend: None/custom minimal – use form-handling service (e.g., Formspree, Getform) or simple serverless function if you prefer.

Data layer: No persistent DB at first; leads delivered to email and optionally mirrored into a Google Sheet via Zapier/Make.

Infra / 3rd-party:

Hosting: Vercel or Netlify for zero-cost/low-cost static hosting and CI.

Forms + automation: Formspree/Getform + Zapier/Make to send leads into your email/CRM (Notion or Airtable).

Scheduling: Calendly (or similar) embedded for discovery calls.

Rationale (3–5 bullets)

Fast to first version: Astro/Next.js + Tailwind + hosted forms lets you ship a polished single-page site in a few hours once content is ready.

Learning value: Reinforces practical modern web dev skills (React, components, basic routing, deployment) that are directly reusable elsewhere.

Low cost/low ops: Static hosting and 3rd-party form tools keep infra cheap and maintenance minimal.

Easy to extend: You can later add a blog, case study pages, or a private client portal without changing stack.

Common patterns: Uses mainstream tools with abundant docs and examples, reducing time lost on obscure issues.

Critical validation questions (3–5)

Do you want to niche this first toward a single primary segment (e.g., tech founders, compliance leaders, or veterans), or keep all four niches visible from day one?

Are you comfortable investing a few hours to build and maintain an Astro/Next.js site, or do you prefer a no-code builder (Carrd/Webflow) for this first version?

For initial offers, do you want to lead with LinkedIn post bundles only, or include short articles as a core offer from the start?

Are you aiming to price early clients near the $0.25–$0.50/word range immediately, or are you willing to start lower for 1–2 clients in exchange for strong testimonials?

Do you intend to rely primarily on LinkedIn outreach/commenting for client acquisition in the first 90 days, or do you plan to add email outreach or other channels immediately?
